NAME
    Net::LastFM - A simple interface to the Last.fm API

SYNOPSIS
      my $lastfm = Net::LastFM->new(
          api_key    => 'XXX',
          api_secret => 'YYY',
      );
      my $data = $lastfm->request_signed(
          method => 'user.getRecentTracks',
          user   => 'lglb',
      );

DESCRIPTION
    The module provides a simple interface to the Last.fm API. To use this
    module, you must first sign up at <http://www.last.fm/api> to receive an
    API key and secret.

    You can then make requests on the API - most of the requests are signed.
    You pass in a hash of paramters and a data structure mirroring the
    response is returned.

    This module confesses if there is an error.

METHODS
  request
    This makes an unsigned request:

      my $data = $lastfm->request( method => 'auth.gettoken' );

  request_signed
    This makes a signed request:

      my $data = $lastfm->request_signed(
          method => 'user.getRecentTracks',
          user   => 'lglb',
      );
